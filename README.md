- 👋 Hi, I’m @PhilSandoval
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and becoming efficient in multiple coding languages. I strive for the best and am willing to aqcuire any knowledge that is willing to be given.
      I hope to start as an intern, gain experience and knowledge, then eventually be offered a full-time position.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the coding language Python3 and Java. I have taken a introduction course for Python3 (Introduction to Script) and I am now current taking an introduction
      course for Java (Found in App Developement) with Southern New Hampshire University. I am currently in pursuit of a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in
      Software Engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project offered to help me gain experience and knowledge. I currently want to expand my horizon with involving myself more with the coding 
      community. I have made some simple projects throughout my schooling and during some courses I took onmy own but want to get more in depth to be able to become a more thorough
      coder/developer/programmer.
